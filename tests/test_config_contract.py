"""What makes this agent THIS agent -- on someone else's account.

The fleet-wide invariants moved to plow-pbc/agent-mgr with the deployment: the
home mount, the uid/gid contract, no credential through compose, no recipe
starting a second gateway, activation refusing a home it does not own. They are
asserted there once for every agent rather than restated in each repo.

What is left is the instance layer, plus the one thing this repo owns outright:
scripts/latch-verdict.py, which is why `check-latch` survived the migration.
Every assertion here exists because getting it wrong is quiet rather than loud,
and unlike this repo's siblings the state on the other side of a mistake belongs
to a different person.
